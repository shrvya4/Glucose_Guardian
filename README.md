🧠 Project Title:
Glucose Guardian A Personalized AI Assistant for Diabetic and Pre-Diabetic Individuals

💡 Opening Hook: The Problem
“What should I eat?” — it’s a simple question, but for 500+ million people living with diabetes and pre-diabetes, it’s a daily struggle that’s anything but simple.
* Every food decision has a direct impact on their blood sugar — and therefore, their long-term health.
* Dining out or even grabbing a snack becomes a guessing game:
    * Will this spike me?
    * What should I pair it with?
    * Which restaurant is safe?
We built a solution that removes this guesswork — forever.

🧠 The Solution: Glucose Guardian
A personalized AI-powered assistant that helps people make instant, data-driven food decisions using their own CGM data.

🔑 Key Features (Sell These with Confidence)
📊 1. CGM Report Intelligence
Users upload their Dexcom CGM report once. Our AI agent reads and summarizes glucose trends:
* What foods spike their sugar
* What meals stabilize it
* Time-of-day patterns and glucose recovery
It builds a personal blood sugar profile unique to each user.

🍽️ 2. Smart Restaurant Recommender
Going out to eat? Just type: “Mexican restaurants in San Jose”
The assistant:
* Finds nearby restaurants using Google Maps
* Simulates or scrapes real menus
* Analyzes the dishes with the user’s CGM data
* Shows:
    * ✅ Safe to Eat
    * ❌ What to Avoid
    * 🧠 Smart Combinations
No more risky guesses at the table.

📸 3. Menu Image Analyzer
Snapped a photo of a restaurant menu? Upload it — the AI extracts the text and evaluates every dish using your CGM history.
This works in cafes, restaurants, even street food stalls — anywhere menus are visual.

💬 4. ChatBuddy — Ask Anything
“Can I eat ice cream?” “How do I handle rice cravings?” “What’s a good post-lunch snack?”
The chatbot gives clear, science-backed answers in 1–2 sentences, personalized by your CGM data.

🔐 Why It Matters
* Diabetics spend 15+ hours/week managing food choices
* Every glucose spike increases risk of long-term complications
